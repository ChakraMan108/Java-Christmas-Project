// We can add names beside each task if required...

Exercise 1: Design the Interfaces and Project Structure
Tasks:
•	Define interfaces for each tier (Menu, Application, Repository).
•	Decide on the representation of money.
•	Define interfaces for objects like Bank Account, User, etc.
•	Define the package structure and assign interfaces to packages.
•	Define the Exception hierarchy.
•	Create a Maven project with dependencies, including JUnit.
•	Distribute the project for subsequent exercises.


Exercise 2: Implement all Components.
Tasks:
•	Implement components based on the defined interfaces.
•	Implement Account classes with inheritance for different account types.
•	Use Java collection objects for the in-memory repository.
•	Write unit tests for each method.
•	Write code in terms of interfaces, not concrete classes


Exercise 3: Verify the Operation of the Application
Tasks:
•	Perform integration testing.
•	Ensure all unit tests pass.
•	Test the application collectively from different viewpoints.
•	Automate tests if possible (e.g., redirecting user input from a text file).

Exercise 4: Create a Persistent Repository
Tasks:
•	Replace the in-memory repository with a persistent one.
•	Explore different ways to make data persistent (avoid serialization).
•	Consider using text files or explore database options like Derby or SQLite.
•	Develop the new repository implementation in stages.
•	Write unit tests to confirm the operation of the persistent repository


Exercise 5: Verify the Operation of the Application
Tasks:
•	Perform integration testing with the new persistent repository.
•	Test the application with an empty data store.
•	Verify previous integration tests still run successfully.
•	Add additional tests to verify stored data.


Encourage code development in stages, focusing on one method or feature at a time.


Notes:

•	Utilize interfaces and avoid relying on concrete classes.
•	Collaborate during integration testing, sharing code for different viewpoints.
•	Use Maven for dependency management and JUnit for unit testing.
•	This plan provides a structured approach to developing the banking simulator, focusing on clear design, implementation, and testing at each stage. It's essential to ensure that each exercise builds upon the previous one, resulting in a robust and well-tested application.
